The blantyreESBL R package is a repository for data generated as part of
a study into carriage of resistant bacteria in Blantyre, Malawi. It also
includes reproducible analysis script for three manuscripts arising from
the study:

[**Dynamics of gut mucosal colonisation with extended spectrum
beta-lactamase producing Enterobacterales in
Malawi**](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/articles/analysis.html)

### Installing and accessing data

If you just want the data, then all the data to replicate the analysis
are bundled with the package. To install the package from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL)
```

The various data objects are described in the
[pkgdown](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/) site for this
package
[here](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/reference/index.html),
and available via R in the usual way (i.e.Â `?btESBL_participants` brings
up the definitions for the `btESBL_participants` data. They are all lazy
loaded so will be available for use immediately; they all start with
`btESBL_` to make it easy to choose the one you want using autocomplete.

### Whole genome sequence accession numbers and metadata

Reads from all isolates sequenced as part of this study have been
depositied in the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA); accession numbers
are available in the `btESBL_sequence_sample_metadata` data frame,
available on installing the package as above.

### Analysis scripts

The analysis scripts to reproduce tables and figures for each manuscript
are available as package vignettes; these can be built when downloading
the package by running:

``` r
devtools::install_github(
  "https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL", 
  build_vignettes = TRUE, 
  dependencies = TRUE )
```

The `dependencies = TRUE` option will install all the packages necessary
to run the vignette. Building the vignettes may take some time - you
have been warned!

Alternatively the source code for the vignettes are `analysis.Rmd`
`analysis-ecoli.Rmd` and `analysis-kleb.Rmd`in the `vignettes/` folder
of the [GitHub](https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL) repo or the
[pkgdown](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/) site for this
package has a rendered version of each vignette.

### Running Stan models

The longitudinal modelling paper uses models fit with Stan, the
probabilistic programming language, via the *rstan* R package. Unlike
the rest if the vignettes (which run the analysis as they are built) the
Stan models are not fit as part of the package vignettes as they take a
long time to fit. The outputs of the models are available as data
objects and a
[vignette](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/articles/fitting-stan-models.html)
provides instructions on how to fit and simulate from the posterior. The
Stan code is available as .stan files in the package directory - see
vignette for how to locate it.
