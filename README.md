### Installing and accessing data

If you just want the data, then all the data to replicate the analysis
are bundled with the package. To install the package from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL)
```

The various data objects are described in the
[pkgdown](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/) site for this
package, and available via R in the usual way
(i.e.Â `?btESBL_participants` brings up the definitions for the
`btESBL_participants` data. They are all lazy loaded so will be
available for use immediately; they all start with `btESBL_` to make it
easy to choose the one you want using autocomplete.

The analysis is available as a package vignette; this can be built when
downloading the package by typing:

``` r
devtools::install_github("https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL", build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE )
```

The `dependencies = TRUE` option will install all the packages necessary
to run the vignette.

Alternatively the source code for the vignette is `analysis.Rmd` in the
`vignettes/` folder of the
[GitHub](https://github.com/joelewis101/blantyreESBL) repo or the
[pkgdown](https://joelewis101.github.io/blantyreESBL/) site for this
package has a rendered version.
